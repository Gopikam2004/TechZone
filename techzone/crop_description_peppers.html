    <h1>Cultivation Techniques:</h1>
    <p>1. Optimal Plant Spacing: Ensure proper spacing between pepper plants to allow for good air circulation. Well-ventilated plants are less prone to fungal diseases, and adequate spacing also prevents the spread of pests. Follow recommended spacing guidelines based on the specific pepper variety being grown.
<br><br>
        2. Fertilization Schedule: Implement a balanced fertilization schedule, providing peppers with the necessary nutrients at different growth stages. Avoid over-fertilization, especially with high-nitrogen fertilizers, as this can make plants more susceptible to certain pests and diseases. Use a fertilizer with a higher ratio of phosphorus and potassium for flowering and fruiting stages.

            Pest and Disease Management for Pepper:
         </h1>
         <p>1. Beneficial Insects: Introduce or encourage beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and predatory mites, to control common pests like aphids and spider mites. These natural predators can help maintain a healthy balance in the ecosystem, reducing the need for chemical interventions.
<br><br>
            2. Mulching:Apply organic mulch, such as straw or shredded leaves, around pepper plants. Mulching helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. This protective layer can also prevent soil-borne diseases by reducing contact between the fruit and the soil.
            </p>
<h1>Harvesting Period for Pepper:
</h1>
<p>1. Mature Color and Size: Harvest peppers when they reach their mature color and size. The color varies depending on the pepper type, transitioning from green to red, yellow, orange, or other hues. The fruit should also have reached its full size, ensuring optimal flavor and texture.
<br><br>
    2. Use Pruning Shears: Use sharp pruning shears or scissors to harvest peppers, cutting the fruit carefully from the plant to avoid damage. Harvesting with clean tools helps prevent the spread of diseases, and leaving a small portion of the stem attached to the pepper can improve post-harvest durability. Regular harvesting encourages continuous production throughout the growing season</p>
