    <h1>Cultivation Techniques:</h1>
    <p>1. Crop Rotation: Practice crop rotation to prevent soil-borne diseases and pests that can affect tomatoes. Avoid planting tomatoes in the same soil where related crops (e.g., peppers, potatoes) were grown in the previous season, as this helps break the life cycle of specific pathogens and pests.
<br><br>
        2.Proper Watering Practices: Provide consistent and even watering to tomatoes, aiming to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Drip irrigation or soaker hoses are effective methods to deliver water directly to the base of the plants, minimizing the risk of foliar diseases and promoting healthy root development.

            Pest and Disease Management for Tomatoes:
         </h1>
         <p>
            1. Companion Planting: Use companion planting strategies, such as planting basil or marigolds near tomatoes, to help repel certain pests and attract beneficial insects. This natural approach can contribute to a healthier and more balanced ecosystem within the garden.
            <br><br>
            2. Early Disease Detection: Regularly inspect tomato plants for signs of common diseases like early blight or late blight. Early detection allows for prompt intervention, such as removing affected leaves, applying fungicides preventively, and adopting cultural practices that limit the spread of diseases.

<h1>Harvesting Period for Tomatoes:
</h1>
<p>1. Mature Color and Firmness: Harvest tomatoes when they reach their mature color, whether it's red, yellow, orange, or another variety-specific hue. Additionally, the fruit should have a firm texture but still yield slightly to gentle pressure, indicating ripeness.
<br><br>
    2. Regular Harvesting: Tomatoes should be harvested regularly once they reach maturity. This encourages continuous fruit production and prevents overripening on the plant, which can attract pests and affect overall plant health. Use clean, sharp shears to cut the tomatoes with a small portion of the stem attached for better storage and handling.</p>
